## McKinsey & Company challenge: Hack the Crash

### Problem Statement

Road transport in UK is very popular for various reasons, but the rate of road accidents and fatality in the country is high. Pressure on roads has been on increase and the number of vehicles is increasing by leaps and bounds.
McKinsey, as a trusted advisor for both private and public sector, was asked to help solving the problem by predicting accident severity. For that task, they need the best team of data scientists - that is you.

As data scientists, you are now responsible for developing a model predicting accident severity based on: 
- Road location
- Road type and its speed limit
- Weather conditions
- Details of vehicles involved in the accident

Predicting accident severity will help the authorities closely monitor accident prone road segments and do a root cause analysis for such mishaps. This will also help them in planning the setup of emergency infrastructure such as hospitals, police stations etc.


## Data Dictionary
A data dictionary with the definition of all the accidents and vehicles variables can be found [here](https://github.com/josepquintana/HackUPC-2019/data/Data_Dictionary.xlsx). 


## Evaluation metrics
